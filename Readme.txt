This is a simple example of naive bayes theorem. Using this you can even develop your own code by adding more
function to it. 

The Files are
1. Play or not1.csv - its the clone file of the data that was present on the original file.
2. Play or Not.csv - This file consists the data that has been used by the code and this file is not touched 
			any kindo of editing has been done in the clone file.
3. Playnot.py - this code of naive bayes is present in tis file it been tested of all the possible answers and it
		has done good in those test.


Also if you need the code to run in the first go you would want to keep the all the files in the same folder.
